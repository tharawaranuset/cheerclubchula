**Introduction**

This project is an official web application owned by the Cheerleading and Card Stunt Club of Chulalongkorn University. It has been developed specifically to support the club’s activities and is strictly prohibited from being used for any purposes unrelated to the club. The application is tailored to address the unique challenges of the club’s operations, particularly in the process of creating large-scale audience displays.

The primary objective of this project is to assist in identifying and managing color indices from images used in visual displays on the audience stands. These indices are crucial for ensuring the accuracy and coordination of the displays during live events. By integrating this application into the workflow, the club can streamline the preparation process, improve communication among team members, and enhance the overall quality of the visual presentations.

To further enrich the application’s usability, additional features have been incorporated to provide a more seamless experience for users. These features are designed to cater to the specific needs of the Cheerleading and Banner Club, ensuring that the application aligns closely with its intended purpose.

The project has been developed using PHP as the primary programming language and SQL as the database management system. These technologies were chosen for their robustness, scalability, and compatibility with the club’s technical infrastructure.

This initiative represents the club’s commitment to leveraging technology to support and preserve its tradition of excellence. By embracing innovation, the Cheerleading and Banner Club seeks to uphold its legacy while enhancing its efficiency and effectiveness in the digital age.
